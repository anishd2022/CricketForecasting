# Cricket Forecasting

- My research project will aims to forecast results of cricket games in terms of runs, wickets, and margins of victory. My work will be supervised by Professor Zes. I plan to communicate with him on a regular basis over the course of my research project, either over zoom or in person. My approach will start off by collecting lots of ball by ball data from thousands of past cricket games from CricInfo. From there, I plan to work with the time series data by using algorithms that attempt to distinguish signal from noise in order to build
successful models to accurately forecast cricket games.
- My final deliverable will be a formal research paper detailing my research and results.
