# Forecasting Scores in T20 Cricket Games

-   Working with Professor Dave Zes at UCLA, I took on a STATS 199 undergraduate research project that aimed to forecast the final score in a T20 inning after an arbitrary intervention point sometime earlier in the inning. I explored various methods, such as linear regression, ARIMA models, KNN simulations, multi-dimensional robust synthetic control (mRSC), and the R [mactivate](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mactivate/mactivate.pdf) library developed by Prof. Zes. I analyzed the accuracy and the pros and cons of each method used.
- My final deliverable `FinalPaper.pdf` is a formal research paper detailing my research and results. This paper can also be found on my website [here](https://anishdeshpande.com/PDFs/ForecastingScores.pdf)
